Enhance this solution so that it first uses a geo: uri intent
failing over to the http://maps.google.com uri prefixed 
intent in the case where geo: intent throws an exception.

Augmented the range checking of the latitude and longitude
to use named constants rather than literals.
The validation of latitude and longitude were moved into
there own methods.  
In the case of latitude the Mercator projection limits
are now detected.
