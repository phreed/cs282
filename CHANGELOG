2012-09-05  Initial submission as Assignment2 for CS 282

2012-09-07  Addressed suggestions by Dr. Doug Schmidt

Enhance this solution so that it first uses a geo: uri intent
failing over to the http://maps.google.com uri prefixed 
intent in the case where geo: intent throws an exception.

Augmented the range checking of the latitude and longitude
to use named constants rather than literals.
The validation of latitude and longitude were moved into
there own methods.  

2012-09-08 Make use of setError for invalid input 

Enhance the error reporting by using the TextView.setError()
method to indicate the incorrect input.
In the case of latitude the Mercator projection limits
are now detected. This is presented as a Toast as it is
not an incorrect thing for which to ask.
