Patterns arise when there is a resonable resolution to a set of constraints.
The constraints can be as varied as the programming language choice with
its attentdant paradyms, the experiences of the development team,
the functional behaviors or performance requirements. 

For example.
Concurency is a primary constraint which can be resolved by.
Threading
Command Pattern
etc.

Many problems can be simplified by eliminate the concurrency 
constraint.  For example the procedure call, synchronous 
presumes no concurency over the call.
