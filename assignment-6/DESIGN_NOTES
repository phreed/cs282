This example makes use of the logback logging framework.
logback can be configured via the "assets/logback.xml" as
part of the android package or via the "/mnt/sdcard/logback/logback-test.xml"
file.

The project makes use of the ViewPager and JSoup.
JSoup is an html parser which is used to harvest 
images from the specified page.

ViewPager is used to display the set of images harvested.

The project does not have a good way of selecting 
a set of images.
