2012-10-27 Addressed comments from Prof. Schmidt

Various code reductions:
1) Replaced 
  final URL url = new URL(uri.toString());
  final InputStream is = url.openConnection().getInputStream();
with
  final InputStream is = new URL(uri.toString()).openStream();

2) Removed the onStartCommand() from the services as it is unused.
3) Created a DownloadServiceConnection generic class.
4) Created a generic method for explicitly binding to services.


Corrected errors in comments:
1) Removed logic and comments dealing with processing of
   URI which are not URL.

Comments:
1) Explained the reason File is used rather than ParcelFileDescriptor.
