2012-09-19  Initial submission as Assignment3 for CS 282

2012-09-22  Addressed comments by Dr. Doug Schmidt

"Can you use Java enums for the [message handling], which are more 'localized'":
I make use of an enum using the ordinal to serialize the item.

"I don't really think it makes sense to use a loop [in the doInBackground]
since it only ever iterates once, even in the failure case.  Am I missing something?"
I typically use a for each in these cases as it saves a check on 
the size of the list, but I made the change as indicated.

"I think you can zap [the onProgressUpdate] method since you're now using it, right?"
I sometimes provided @Override methods to indicate that they are 
intentionally unchanged.  I have removed this method.
However I have left a couple of empty methods in the main Activity.


2012-09-25 Make use of the setError method on the URL edit field

Enhance the error reporting by using the TextView.setError()
method to indicate the incorrect URL.

The download may fail for a number of reasons related to the network
I decided to indicate these as warnings

2012-09-23 Preseve state with fragments

I had been wanting to learn how to use fragments anyway.
The textbook recommends using fragments to preserve state.
The main win is that leaving the activity and returning 
will retain state using the fragment technique.
The loss is that more memory is consumed persisting the fragment.

My daughter sent me new photos so I used them instead
of those of our instructor.

2012-09-25 Protect the bitmap from contention

There is a slight possiblility that more than on thread may
try to update the bitmap image concurrently.  To prevent this
a synchronize block has been placed around the updates to 
the bitmap items.
