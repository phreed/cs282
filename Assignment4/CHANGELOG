Remaining issues:

Regarding the proper functioning of the progress indicator.
In the saveInstanceState bundle retain a list of pending requests.
When the activity shuts down it tells the service to forget about the notifications.
When the activity restarts it tells the service to generate notices.
The bridge then is the uuid of the individual requests.

URI rather than URL.
This is not complete the URI field must be a valid URL.
