This example makes use of the logback logging framework.
logback can be configured via the "assets/logback.xml" as
part of the android package or via the "/mnt/sdcard/logback/logback-test.xml"
file.

I am in the process of adding a test for the service and activity.
There are some issues with the current solution.
1) cursor loader is always active, the button does nothing important.
   The cursor loader startes immediately.
2) The content provider needs a notifyChange call for any observers.
3) The provided url will be scanned for images and all of the
   images will be stored in the content provider.
4) Both the cursor and the file descriptor should be loaded asynchronously.
5) An image gallery will be presented.
6) One of the buttons will be used for showing the sets of urls 
   from which one will be current.
